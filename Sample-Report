# Titile :- 
Firebase takeover leads to tamper with website's static files

# Discription ;- 
I found your Firebase configuration on a app res/values/strings.xml endpoint, the firebase is misconfigured, and an attacker can take over the firebase and tamper with the websites' static files.A "Firebase takeover" typically refers to a situation where someone gains unauthorized access to a Firebase project or account. Firebase is a platform by Google that provides various services for building and managing web and mobile applications. When a takeover occurs, it can have significant negative

# Configuration:- 

{
  "apiKey": null,
  "authDomain": "null.firebaseapp.com",
  "databaseURL": "https://null.firebaseio.com",
  "projectId": null,
  "storageBucket": "null.appspot.com",
  "appId": "111",
  "measurementId": "111222"
}

please go to https://firebase.projectnull.tech/ , which is a PoC tool to demonstrate the bug. And use a browser open that html file, then input the ProjectID with , and the ApiKey with  , and finally click the submit button twice, you will observe all websites' static files that were stored in the firebase storage, and a file named apoc.txt was uploaded to the firebase storage. It proved all static files in the firebase storage are vulnerable to tampering.

Please see my screenshot in the attachment

# Impact

Data Breach: Unauthorized access to a Firebase project can lead to the exposure of sensitive user data, including personal information, login credentials, and more. This can result in a data breach, which may have legal and financial consequences for the owner of the Firebase project.

Data Manipulation: Attackers who gain control of a Firebase project can manipulate or delete data stored in the Firebase Realtime Database, Firestore, or Cloud Storage. This can disrupt the functionality of the associated application and harm its users.

Unauthorized Access: A takeover can allow attackers to gain control over the Firebase project's resources and configurations. They may impersonate the legitimate owner and make unauthorized changes to the project, such as modifying authentication settings, cloud functions, or hosting configurations.

Service Disruption: Attackers may intentionally disrupt the services hosted on Firebase, causing downtime for the application. This can result in a loss of revenue for businesses that rely on Firebase for their applications.

Reputation Damage: A security breach can damage the reputation of the affected organization or developer. Users may lose trust in the service, and it can be challenging to regain that trust once it's lost.

Legal Consequences: Depending on the nature of the takeover and the data involved, there may be legal consequences for the attacker as well as the owner of the Firebase project. Data protection laws, such as GDPR in Europe, can lead to fines and legal actions if user data is mishandled.

To mitigate the impact of a Firebase takeover, it's essential to follow best practices for securing Firebase projects:

Implement strong authentication methods, such as Firebase Authentication, and regularly review access permissions.

Monitor Firebase usage and set up alerting for suspicious activities.

Enable security rules for Firebase services to restrict access to authorized users and limit potential damage.

Use Firebase's built-in security features, like Firebase Security Rules, to control access to your data.

Educate your development team about security best practices and conduct security audits regularly.

Be prepared with an incident response plan to quickly address and recover from security incidents.

In case of a Firebase takeover, it's crucial to act swiftly to regain control of your Firebase project, investigate the breach, and notify affected users as required by data protection regulations. Additionally, you should work with security experts and legal counsel to manage the situation effectively.
